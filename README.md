## Overview
### Features
ProgressGif does one thing only.
1. Import video
2. Add a progress bar
3. Export as a gif

### Uses
Tutorials with just words are boring, so we add images. And if they need to be more detailed, we add video... but video isn't always the best choice. Readers may not want to turn on audio, and if they're reading on their phone, the video will open in a full-screen modal.



ProgressGif is an iOS app made with Swift 5 and UIKit.
