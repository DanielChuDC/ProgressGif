## Overview
### Features
ProgressGif does one thing only.
1. Import video
2. Add a progress bar
3. Export as gif

### Uses
Tutorials with only words are boring, so we add images. And if they need to be more detailed, we add video... but video isn't always the best choice.
- Readers may not want to turn on audio.
- If they're on their phone, the video will open in a full-screen modal. That disrupts the reading experience.

### About
ProgressGif is an iOS app made with Swift 5 and UIKit.
