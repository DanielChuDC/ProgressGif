## Overview
### Features
ProgressGif does one thing only.
1. Import video
2. Add a progress bar
3. Export as a gif

### Uses
Tutorials with just words are boring, so we add images. And if they need to be more detailed, we add video some blogging sites like Medium 

When writing tutorials or just blogging, words aren't enough. Pictures are great. So are videos. And in between them are gifs.

ProgressGif is an iOS app made with Swift 5 and UIKit.
